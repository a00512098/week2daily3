# Week 2 Daily 3

This app uses localization to show 5 TextViews in 6 different languages. The text of the TextViews is a poem by Pablo Neruda.

This is how the app looks:

| Spanish       | English       | French|
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :----:|
| ![alt text][spanish] | ![alt text][english] | ![alt text][french] |

| Portuguese       | Italian       | German|
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :----:|
| ![alt text][portuguese] | ![alt text][italian] | ![alt text][german] |
